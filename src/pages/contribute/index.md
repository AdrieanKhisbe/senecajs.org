# Contribute
[Seneca][], [Senecajs.org][], and all official plugins are __open__ projects and encourage
participation. If you feel you can help in any way, be it with documentation, examples, extra
testing, or new features, please be our guest! =)

Contributing is not always about adding new features. There are plenty of other ways to get
involved. For instance:

- Add more tests, be they unit tests or performance-based tests.
- Write guides and documentation or proof-read and fix existing docs.
- Report, find or fix bugs, or all three.
- Add examples of usage, patterns or integration with other tools.

Like any other project, there is plenty to be done by people of all skill levels and specialities.
If you have any questions, or want to help out, please stop by our issues boards.

- For issues or questions about how to contribute or our documentation, go to [Senecajs.org][] and it's [issues][org_issues]
- For issues or questions on Seneca itself, go to [Seneca][code_issues].
