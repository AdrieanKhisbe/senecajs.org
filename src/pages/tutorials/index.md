# Tutorials
Seneca tutorials offer a deep dive into a particular concept or feature. There are also partner tutorials that go with some of the [sample projects][].

## The basics

- [Logging with Seneca][]
- [How to write a plugin][]
- [Understanding data entities][]
- [Understanding prior actions][]

## Sample projects
Sample projects are awesome. At Seneca, we have a good chunk of them available to study and extend. This page
is broken down into samples and full apps. Samples offer simple tutorial-style projects. Full apps are more complex
examples of working services.

### Samples
For convenience, we have a number of samples in a single repository. This repository covers single concepts
as well as popular plugins. This repository is open sourced; pull requests are welcome. See the repo at [Seneca samples][].

## Full apps
Full apps are much more complex than samples. They are production quality microservices. We
try to include as many plugins as possible in order to demonstrate their use.

### Well!
This is a simple networking game implemented as a mobile web app. Its purpose is to serve as an example of a real app, built with Node.js, Sencha Touch, and Seneca. As such, it has non-trivial functionality, and there are some warts and hacks. Decide for yourself if this set of tools is right for you. See the repo at [Well!][].

### nodezoo
This is the nodezoo.com project, a search engine for Node.js modules. The nodezoo search engine is an example of a real-world service built using Node.js microservices. Each microservice is published in its own GitHub repository. The code base is intended to be used as a larger-scale example and as a starting point for your own projects. See the repo at [nodezoo][].
