Data Stores:

- Plugins should always have -store suffix
- Date objects should not be used - behaviour on load is undef - might be an ISO string, might be a date
- Close should force sync of underlying data store
- Custom actions should use role:<plugin>, not role:entity. e.g. role:mem-store, cmd:dump

- to document
  - canonical order of ent designation parts: zone,base,name
  - stores handle base and name as base_name
  - stores do not handle zones
